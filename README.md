# Sync Todoist - Obsidian Plugin

### Summary
With this plugin it is possible to create `Todoist` tasks from `Obsidian` and keep them in sync bidirectionally.
Its usage is very simple after the plugin has been connected to your Todoist account.
When you add the `#todoist` tag to a task (or checkbox item) it will automatically be created on Todoist and from that moment onward, the Todoist and Obsidian task will be synced.

### Features
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in Obsidian or Todoist are synced both ways
- **Subtasks**: Indented tasks beneath a `#todoist` parent are synced as subtasks automatically — no tag needed on each child
- **Import from Todoist**: Search and import any Todoist task (with its subtasks) into your note via a fuzzy-search modal
- **Projects & Labels**: Per-task project assignment with `📁 ProjectName` metadata, bidirectional label sync via `#hashtags`
- **Query Blocks**: Embed live Todoist task lists in your notes using `sync-todoist` code blocks (e.g., `filter: today`)
- **Tasks Plugin Compatible**: Works with the popular Obsidian Tasks plugin emojis (📅, ⏫, 🔼, 🔽)
- **Configurable**: Customize sync tag, default project, sync interval, and conflict resolution
- **Commands**: Quick commands to create tasks, import tasks, and trigger sync
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose how to handle conflicts (Obsidian wins, Todoist wins, or ask)
- **Zero Dependencies**: Direct Todoist API v1 integration via Obsidian's built-in `requestUrl` — no external SDKs

### Installation

#### From Community Plugins (After Approval)
1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community plugins
2. Click "Browse" and search for "Sync Todoist"
3. Install and enable the plugin
4. Configure your Todoist API token in the plugin settings

#### Manual Installation
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/o1xhack/obsidian-sync-todoist/releases)
2. Create a folder `sync-todoist` in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into that folder
4. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings

#### From Source (Development)
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
3. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into `.obsidian/plugins/sync-todoist/` in a test vault
4. Enable Community plugins in Settings → Community plugins
5. Enable the "Sync Todoist" plugin

### Configuration

1. Get your Todoist API token from [Todoist Settings → Integrations → Developer](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer)
2. Open plugin settings in Obsidian
3. Enter your API token and click "Verify"
4. Configure other settings as needed:
   - **Sync Tag**: Tag to mark tasks for sync (default: `#todoist`)
   - **Default Project**: Where new tasks go (default: Inbox)
   - **Sync Interval**: Auto-sync frequency in minutes
   - **Conflict Resolution**: How to handle conflicting changes

### Usage

#### Creating Tasks
Add the `#todoist` tag to any task:
```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries #todoist
- [ ] Meeting with team #todoist 📅 2026-01-28 ⏫
```

After sync, the task will have a Todoist ID:
```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries #todoist <!-- todoist-id:8765432109 -->
```

#### Subtasks
Indent tasks beneath a `#todoist`-tagged parent. Subtasks inherit the sync tag automatically — you do **not** need to add `#todoist` to each one:
```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries #todoist <!-- todoist-id:111 -->
  - [ ] Milk <!-- todoist-id:222 -->
  - [ ] Bread <!-- todoist-id:333 -->
  - [ ] Eggs
```

- Subtasks are synced as Todoist subtasks (using `parentId`)
- New indented tasks without a Todoist ID are created as subtasks on the next sync
- Subtask hierarchy is preserved in both directions

#### Importing Tasks from Todoist
Use the command **"Import task from Todoist"** to search for any open Todoist task and insert it at your cursor:

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`)
2. Run "Sync Todoist: Import task from Todoist"
3. Search by task content, project, label, or due date
4. Select a task — it and its subtasks are inserted as synced markdown

#### Projects and Labels
Assign a project to a task using the `📁` emoji:
```markdown
- [ ] Design review #todoist #design #urgent 📁 WorkProject 📅 2026-03-05 <!-- todoist-id:123 -->
```

- `📁 ProjectName` sets the Todoist project for the task (overrides the default project)
- `#hashtags` (other than the sync tag) are synced as Todoist labels, bidirectionally
- Project names are resolved from the Todoist project list and cached

#### Query Blocks (Show Today's Tasks)
Embed a live, interactive task list in any note using a `sync-todoist` code block:

````markdown
```sync-todoist
filter: today
```
````

The block renders as a styled task list with checkboxes, priorities, projects, and due dates. You can complete or reopen tasks directly from the rendered block.

**Supported filters** (uses [Todoist filter syntax](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters-702348ff)):

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `filter: today` | Tasks due today |
| `filter: overdue` | Overdue tasks |
| `filter: today \| overdue` | Combined filters |
| `filter: #ProjectName` | Tasks in a project |
| `filter: @label` | Tasks with a label |
| `filter: p1` | High priority tasks |

To include completed tasks, keep `filter:` as Todoist filter syntax and add Sync Todoist-specific options:

````markdown
```sync-todoist
filter: today
include_completed: true
completed_by: due_date
```
````

Completed task search uses Todoist's completed-task archive endpoints, which require a bounded date window. If no window is configured, Sync Todoist uses the last 6 weeks for `completed_by: due_date` and the last 30 days for `completed_by: completion_date`. Label and project filters default to `completion_date`; date-oriented filters default to `due_date`.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `include_completed: true` | Merge active results with matching completed tasks |
| `completed_by: due_date` | Find completed tasks by their Todoist due date |
| `completed_by: completion_date` | Find completed tasks by when they were completed |
| `completed_since: 30d` | Start of the completed-task window (`30d`, `6w`, `3m`, `today`, `yesterday`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `completed_until: today` | End of the completed-task window (`today`, `now`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `completed_range: today` | Shortcut for one bounded range (`today`, `yesterday`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, `30d`, `6w`, `3m`) |

Example for recently completed label work:

````markdown
```sync-todoist
filter: @writing
include_completed: true
completed_by: completion_date
completed_since: 30d
```
````

Each query block includes a refresh button and shows when it was last updated.

#### Commands
- **Create Todoist task from current line**: Convert current line to a synced task
- **Import task from Todoist**: Search and import a Todoist task at cursor
- **Sync with Todoist now**: Manually trigger sync
- **Open Sync Todoist settings**: Quick access to settings

### Supported Task Formats

| Emoji | Meaning | Todoist Mapping |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 📅 | Due date | Task due date |
| ⏫ | High priority | Priority 4 |
| 🔼 | Medium priority | Priority 3 |
| 🔽 | Low priority | Priority 2 |
| 📁 | Project | Task project |

### Network Usage

This plugin connects directly to the **Todoist API v1** (via Obsidian's built-in `requestUrl`) to sync tasks. There are no external SDK dependencies. Your Todoist API token is stored locally in Obsidian's plugin data and is only used to communicate with Todoist's servers (`api.todoist.com`).

### Development

To build the plugin from source:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To lint:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### About This Plugin

- Direct Todoist API v1 integration — no external SDKs, only Obsidian's built-in `requestUrl`
- Query blocks support both the primary `sync-todoist` code block language and the original `syncist` alias for migration.
